# Choosing the Right C Library for Embedded Systems: Newlib, picolibc, nanolib, and dietlibc



# Introduction

In our previous [post on the C Runtime](./Understanding_the_C_Runtime_crt.md), we explored the essential startup components like `crt0`, `crti`, and `crtn` that prepare the execution environment before your `main()` function is even called. These startup files often work closely with the **C Standard Library (libc)**, the engine providing fundamental functions like `printf`, `malloc`, `strcpy`, and many others that we rely on daily.

While desktop and server systems typically utilize comprehensive libraries  such as glibc (GNU C Library) or Microsoft’s CRT, the world of embedded  systems presents unique challenges. Resource-constrained environments  often grapple with strict limitations on memory (both Flash/ROM for code storage and RAM for execution). Deploying a full-featured libc in these scenarios can quickly consume these precious resources, rendering them  impractical.

This post dives into several popular alternative C libraries specifically  designed or adapted for these constrained environments: **Newlib**, **picolibc**, **nanolib**, and **dietlibc**. We’ll examine their design goals, strengths, weaknesses, typical use  cases, and illustrate their concepts with simple examples.

# What is a C Standard Library (Libc)?

A C Standard Library, often simply “libc”, is a standardized collection of header files (e.g., `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`) and the corresponding compiled code (functions) that implement common  operations defined by the C standard (like ISO C99, C11, C17).

Key functionalities provided by libc include:

- Input/Output (e.g., `printf`, `scanf`, `fopen`, `fread`)
- String Manipulation (e.g., `strcpy`, `strlen`, `strcmp`)
- Memory Management (e.g., `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`)
- Mathematical Functions (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt` via `<math.h>`)
- Utility Functions (e.g., `atoi`, `exit`, `qsort`)

In essence, libc provides the essential toolkit that makes C a versatile  language, abstracting away many low-level operating system or hardware  interactions.

# Why Not Use Standard Desktop Libraries (like glibc)?

Libraries like glibc are powerful and feature-rich, targeting extensive POSIX  compliance and supporting a vast array of functionalities  (internationalization, advanced networking, sophisticated threading,  etc.). However, this comprehensiveness comes at a cost prohibitive for  many embedded systems:

1. **Size:** glibc results in large binaries (static linking) or requires a large  shared library plus significant runtime memory. This is often infeasible for microcontrollers with kilobytes, not gigabytes, of memory.
2. **Dependencies:** It typically assumes a full operating system environment (like Linux)  with features like virtual memory, file systems, and complex process  management, which are absent in bare-metal or simple RTOS scenarios.
3. **Complexity:** Its intricate internal workings can be overkill and harder to debug or customize for minimalistic environments.

Embedded systems demand libraries that are lean, modular, and minimally dependent on underlying OS features.

# Exploring the Alternatives for Embedded Systems

Several C libraries cater specifically to these needs. Let’s explore four prominent examples:

# Newlib

- **Origin:** Developed by Cygnus Solutions (now part of Red Hat).
- **Goal:** A portable, open-source C library for embedded systems, including bare-metal and RTOS environments.
- **Key Features:** High portability, good C standard compliance, configurable features. Crucially, it uses a **system call (syscall) stub** mechanism. Functions needing OS/hardware interaction (like I/O or heap management) call weak-linked stub functions (e.g., `_read`, `_write`, `_sbrk`) that **you must implement** for your target platform.
- **Example (Syscall Stub Implementation):** To make `printf` work via a UART on a bare-metal system, you might implement the `_write` stub like this:

```
#include <unistd.h> // For STDOUT_FILENO, etc. (may vary)
#include "my_uart_driver.h" // Your hardware-specific UART functions
// _write syscall stub implementation for Newlib
int _write(int file, char *ptr, int len) {
    // Only handle stdout (file descriptor 1)
    if (file == STDOUT_FILENO) {
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            // Send character via UART, wait if necessary
            my_uart_putchar(ptr[i]);
        }
        return len; // Return the number of characters written
    }
    // Handle other file descriptors or return error (e.g., EBADF)
    // errno = EBADF;
    return -1;
}
```

*(Note: The exact signature and required includes might vary slightly based on the toolchain and target.)*

- **Pros:** Mature, widely adopted (especially with `arm-none-eabi-gcc`), good balance of features.
- **Cons:** Can still be relatively large by default, requires mandatory platform-specific syscall implementation.
- **Typical Use:** Bare-metal firmware, RTOS applications (FreeRTOS, Zephyr often use it), cross-compilation toolchains.

# picolibc

- **Origin:** Developed by Keith Packard, combining ideas from Newlib and AVR Libc.
- **Goal:** A C library optimized for **size** on 32/64-bit embedded systems, balancing footprint with usability and modern tooling.
- **Key Features:** Based on Newlib/AVR Libc code, focus on minimalism, uses the **Meson build system** for easier configuration, offers selectable stdio implementations  (integer-only, float support), optimized math routines. Like Newlib, it  relies on the **syscall stub** mechanism requiring user implementation.
- **Example (Syscall Stub):** The implementation approach for syscalls like `_write` or `_sbrk` in picolibc is identical to Newlib. You would provide the same kind of  platform-specific code as shown in the Newlib example above. The  difference lies in picolibc’s internal implementation of functions like `printf`, which are designed to be smaller.
- **Pros:** Noticeably smaller than default Newlib, modern and flexible build system, good size-optimization options, active development.
- **Cons:** Relatively newer than Newlib, though gaining traction rapidly.
- **Typical Use:** Size-critical embedded projects (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V) needing standard C functions but prioritizing minimal footprint. A strong alternative to Newlib when space is tight.

# nanolib (Newlib-nano / nano.specs)

- **Origin:** A **configuration variant** of Newlib, included with toolchains like `arm-none-eabi-gcc`. Not a separate source library.
- **Goal:** Provide an extremely size-optimized build of Newlib by stripping down functionalities, especially I/O and memory allocation.
- **Key Features:** Activated via a compiler flag (`-specs=nano.specs`) during the link stage. Replaces standard Newlib functions with minimal versions (e.g., `printf` often lacks float support by default). Sacrifices features for code size.
- **Example (Enabling and Impact):**

1. **Compile & Link Command:**

```
arm-none-eabi-gcc my_app.c -mcpu=cortex-m0plus -mthumb -Os \  -Wl,--gc-sections,--print-memory-usage \ -specs=nano.specs -o my_app.elf
```

1. The `-specs=nano.specs` flag tells the linker to use the nano-variant libraries.
2. **Code Impact (Conceptual):**

```
#include <stdio.h> int main() { float pi = 3.14159f; // With nano.specs  (by default), this likely prints garbage or 0 for %f // unless float  support is explicitly linked via other flags. printf("Integer: %d,  Float: %f\n", 123, pi); // Integer formatting usually works fine.  printf("Integer only: %d\n", 456); return 0; }
```

- **Pros:** Significant reduction in libc footprint with just a compiler flag. Ideal for very constrained microcontrollers.
- **Cons:** Reduced functionality (no float `printf`/`scanf` by default, potentially simplified `malloc`). Behavior might differ subtly from full Newlib. Tied to the toolchain’s specific build.
- **Typical Use:** Tiny microcontroller projects (e.g., Cortex-M0/M0+) where flash/ROM space is extremely limited.

# dietlibc

- **Origin:** Developed by Felix von Leitner.
- **Goal:** To be the smallest possible C standard library, specifically targeting **statically linked executables** on Linux systems.
- **Key Features:** Aggressively size-optimized. Implements Linux system calls directly (no stub layer needed *on Linux*). Aims for compatibility but prioritizes size over full POSIX compliance  or obscure features. Primarily designed for static linking.
- **Example (Static Linking):** Dietlibc often comes with wrapper scripts for GCC (like `diet gcc`) to simplify static linking:

```
# Using the dietlibc wrapper script diet gcc -static my_linux_app.c -o  my_linux_app_static # Manually achieving similar result (conceptual,  paths vary) # gcc my_linux_app.c -nostdlib /path/to/dietlibc/lib/crt0.o \ # -I/path/to/dietlibc/include -L/path/to/dietlibc/lib -ldiet -lc
```

- The result is typically a very small, self-contained executable ideal for embedded Linux devices.
- **Pros:** Extremely small binary sizes, potentially faster startup for simple apps.
- **Cons:** Primarily Linux-focused, less portable to non-Linux or bare-metal. Less POSIX compliant than others. Development seems less active recently.  Can have non-standard behaviors.
- **Typical Use:** Embedded Linux systems (routers, appliances) where executable size is paramount.

# Integration with the C Runtime (crt0)

As detailed in our [previous C Runtime post](https://www.inferara.com/en/blog/c-runtime/), the `crt0` object file contains the `_start` entry point and performs crucial setup before `main`. When using these specialized C libraries, the `crt0` is often simplified and tailored:

- **Newlib/picolibc:** Typically use a minimal `crt0` provided by the embedded toolchain (e.g., `arm-none-eabi-gcc`) or a custom one supplied by an RTOS or BSP (Board Support Package). This `crt0` initializes memory (`.data`, `.bss`), sets up the stack, potentially configures the heap pointer needed by `_sbrk` (if `malloc` is used), and finally calls `main`.
- **nanolib:** Uses the same minimal `crt0` as the full Newlib version it’s derived from within the toolchain.
- **dietlibc:** Often bundles its own highly optimized `crt0` (`crt0.o`), specifically designed to work with dietlibc internals and minimize startup overhead for statically linked Linux executables.

Using compiler flags like `-nostartfiles` (supply your own `crt0`) or `-nostdlib` (exclude standard libraries *and* startup files) allows fine-grained control, often necessary when  integrating these libraries, especially in bare-metal scenarios.

# Choosing the Right Library for Your Project

Selecting the best libc hinges on your specific project constraints:

- **Need broad compatibility, features, and maturity for bare-metal/RTOS?** **Newlib** is a proven choice, assuming you can accommodate its size and implement the required syscalls.
- **Prioritizing code size on bare-metal/RTOS while needing reasonable C standard support?** **picolibc** offers a modern, smaller alternative to Newlib, often with significant size savings.
- **Using** `**arm-none-eabi-gcc**` **(or similar) and hitting severe Flash/ROM limits?** Try **nanolib** (`-specs=nano.specs`) for a quick size win, but verify that the reduced functionality (e.g., float printing) is acceptable.
- **Developing small, statically linked executables for Embedded Linux?** **dietlibc** excels in this specific niche, producing exceptionally small binaries.

Always profile the final binary size, RAM usage, and performance on your actual target hardware to validate your choice.

# Conclusion

The C standard library is indispensable, but one size doesn’t fit all,  especially in the diverse landscape of embedded systems. Libraries like **Newlib**, its slimmed-down variant **nanolib**, the modern size-optimized **picolibc**, and the minimalist **dietlibc** provide crucial alternatives to larger libraries like glibc. They offer tailored trade-offs between code footprint, feature set, portability,  and standard compliance. Understanding these options, along with the  underlying C Runtime mechanisms discussed previously, empowers  developers to build efficient and functional software even on the most  resource-constrained platforms. Choosing the right libc is a key step in optimizing embedded applications, ensuring they fit within tight memory budgets while providing the necessary standard functionalities.
