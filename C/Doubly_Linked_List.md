## Doubly Linked List

## diagram

 doubly linked list is a more complex data structure  than a singly linked list, but it offers several advantages. The main  advantage of a doubly linked list is that it allows for efficient  traversal of the list in both directions. This is because each node in  the list contains a pointer to the previous node and a pointer to the  next node. This allows for quick and easy insertion and deletion of  nodes from the list, as well as efficient traversal of the list in both  directions.

### Representation of Doubly Linked List in Data Structure

In a data structure, a doubly linked list is represented using nodes that have three fields:

1. Data

2. A pointer to the next node (***\*next\****)

3. A pointer to the previous node (***\*prev\****)
