**I built this guide because I could never quite wrap my head around
Makefiles.** They seemed awash with hidden rules and esoteric symbols,
and asking simple questions didnâ€™t yield simple answers. To solve this,
I sat down for several weekends and read everything I could about
Makefiles. I've condensed the most critical knowledge into this guide.
Each topic has a brief description and a self contained example that you
can run yourself.

If you mostly understand Make, consider checking out the Makefile
Cookbook, which has a template for medium sized projects with ample
comments about what each part of the Makefile is doing.

Good luck, and I hope you are able to slay the confusing world of
Makefiles!

Getting Started
===============

Why do Makefiles exist? 
-----------------------

Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to
be recompiled. In the vast majority of cases, C or C++ files are
compiled. Other languages typically have their own tools that serve a
similar purpose as Make. It can be used beyond programs too, when you
need a series of instructions to run depending on what files have
changed. This tutorial will focus on the C/C++ compilation use case.

Here's an example dependency graph that you might build with Make. If
any file's dependencies changes, then the file will get recompiled:

<div class="center">

![](/assets/dependency_graph.png)

</div>

What alternatives are there to Make? 
------------------------------------

Popular C/C++ alternative build systems are [SCons](https://scons.org/),
[CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), and
[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/). Some code editors like [Microsoft
Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) have their own built
in build tools. For Java, there's [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/),
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html), and
[Gradle](https://gradle.org/). Other languages like Go and Rust have
their own build tools.

Interpreted languages like Python, Ruby, and Javascript don't require an
analogue to Makefiles. The goal of Makefiles is to compile whatever
files need to be compiled, based on what files have changed. But when
files in interpreted languages change, nothing needs to get recompiled.
When the program runs, the most recent version of the file is used.

Running the Examples
--------------------

To run these examples, you'll need a terminal and "make" installed. For
each example, put the contents in a file called `Makefile`, and in that
directory run the command `make`. Let's start with the simplest of
Makefiles:

    hello:
        echo "hello world"

Here is the output of running the above example:

    $ make
    echo "hello world"
    hello world

That's it! If you're a bit confused, here's a video that goes through
these steps, along with describing the basic structure of Makefiles.


Makefile Syntax
---------------

A Makefile consists of a set of *rules*. A rule generally looks like
this:

    targets: prerequisites
       command
       command
       command

-   The *targets* are file names, separated by spaces. Typically, there
    is only one per rule.
-   The *commands* are a series of steps typically used to make the
    target(s). These *need to start with a tab character*, not spaces.
-   The *prerequisites* are also file names, separated by spaces. These
    files need to exist before the commands for the target are run.
    These are also called *dependencies*

Beginner Examples
-----------------

The following Makefile has three separate *rules*. When you run
`make blah` in the terminal, it will build a program called `blah` in a
series of steps:

-   Make is given `blah` as the target, so it first searches for this
    target
-   `blah` requires `blah.o`, so make searches for the `blah.o` target
-   `blah.o` requires `blah.c`, so make searches for the `blah.c` target
-   `blah.c` has no dependencies, so the `echo` command is run
-   The `cc -c` command is then run, because all of the `blah.o`
    dependencies are finished
-   The top `cc` command is run, because all the `blah` dependencies are
    finished
-   That's it: `blah` is a compiled c program

<!-- -->

    blah: blah.o
        cc blah.o -o blah # Runs third

    blah.o: blah.c
        cc -c blah.c -o blah.o # Runs second

    blah.c:
        echo "int main() { return 0; }" > blah.c # Runs first

This makefile has a single target, called `some_file`. The default
target is the first target, so in this case `some_file` will run.

    some_file:
        echo "This line will always print"

This file will make `some_file` the first time, and the second time
notice it's already made, resulting in
`make: 'some_file' is up to date.`

    some_file:
        echo "This line will only print once"
        touch some_file

Here, the target `some_file` "depends" on `other_file`. When we run
`make`, the default target (`some_file`, since it's first) will get
called. It will first look at its list of *dependencies*, and if any of
them are older, it will first run the targets for those dependencies,
and then run itself. The second time this is run, neither target will
run because both targets exist.

    some_file: other_file
        echo "This will run second, because it depends on other_file"
        touch some_file

    other_file:
        echo "This will run first"
        touch other_file

This will always run both targets, because `some_file` depends on
other\_file, which is never created.

    some_file: other_file
        touch some_file

    other_file:
        echo "nothing"

`clean` is often used as a target that removes the output of other
targets, but it is not a special word in `make`.

    some_file: 
        touch some_file

    clean:
        rm -f some_file

Variables
---------

Variables can only be strings. Here's an example of using them:

    files = file1 file2
    some_file: $(files)
        echo "Look at this variable: " $(files)
        touch some_file

    file1:
        touch file1
    file2:
        touch file2

    clean:
        rm -f file1 file2 some_file

Reference variables using \${} or \$()

    x = dude

    all:
        echo $(x)
        echo ${x}

        # Bad practice, but works
        echo $x

Targets
=======

The all target
--------------

Making multiple targets and you want all of them to run? Make a `all`
target.

    all: one two three

    one:
        touch one
    two:
        touch two
    three:
        touch three

    clean:
        rm -f one two three

Multiple targets
----------------

When there are multiple targets for a rule, the commands will be run for
each target\
`$@` is an [automatic variable](#automatic-variables) that contains the
target name.

    all: f1.o f2.o

    f1.o f2.o:
        echo $@
    # Equivalent to:
    # f1.o
    #     echo $@
    # f2.o
    #     echo $@

Automatic Variables and Wildcards
=================================

\* Wildcard 
-----------

Both `*` and `%` are called wildcards in Make, but they mean entirely
different things. `*` search your filesystem for matching filenames. I
suggest that you always wrap it in the `wildcard` function, because
otherwise you may fall into a common pitfall described below. It's oddly
unhelpful and I find it more confusing than useful.

    # Print out file information about every .c file
    print: $(wildcard *.c)
        ls -la  $?

`*` may be used in the target, prerequisites, or in the `wildcard`
function.

Danger: `*` may not be directly used in a variable definitions

Danger: When `*` matches no files, it is left as it is (unless run in
the `wildcard` function)

    thing_wrong := *.o # Don't do this! '*' will not get expanded
    thing_right := $(wildcard *.o)

    all: one two three four

    # Fails, because $(thing_wrong) is the string "*.o"
    one: $(thing_wrong)

    # Stays as *.o if there are no files that match this pattern :(
    two: *.o 

    # Works as you would expect! In this case, it does nothing.
    three: $(thing_right)

    # Same as rule three
    four: $(wildcard *.o)

% Wildcard 
----------

`%` is really useful, but is somewhat confusing because of the variety
of situations it can be used in.

-   When used in "matching" mode, it matches one or more characters in a
    string. This match is called the stem.
-   When used in "replacing" mode, it takes the stem that was matched
    and replaces that in a string.
-   `%` is most often used in rule definitions and in some specific
    functions.

See these sections on examples of it being used:

-   [Static Pattern Rules](#static-pattern-rules)
-   [Pattern Rules](#pattern-rules)
-   [String Substitution](#string-substitution)
-   [The vpath Directive](#the-vpath-directive)

Automatic Variables
-------------------

There are many [automatic
variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html),
but often only a few show up:

    hey: one two
        # Outputs "hey", since this is the first target
        echo $@

        # Outputs all prerequisites newer than the target
        echo $?

        # Outputs all prerequisites
        echo $^

        touch hey

    one:
        touch one

    two:
        touch two

    clean:
        rm -f hey one two

Fancy Rules
===========

Static Pattern Rules
--------------------

Make loves c compilation. And every time it expresses its love, things
get confusing. Here's the syntax for a new type of rule called a static
pattern:

    targets ...: target-pattern: prereq-patterns ...
       commands

The essence is that the given target is matched by the target-pattern
(via a `%` wildcard). Whatever was matched is called the *stem*. The
stem is then substituted into the prereq-pattern, to generate the
target's prereqs.

A typical use case is to compile `.c` files into `.o` files. Here's the
*manual way*:

    objects = foo.o bar.o all.o
    all: $(objects)

    # These files compile via implicit rules
    foo.o: foo.c
    bar.o: bar.c
    all.o: all.c

    all.c:
        echo "int main() { return 0; }" > all.c

    %.c:
        touch $@

    clean:
        rm -f *.c *.o all

Here's the more *efficient way*, using a static pattern rule:

    objects = foo.o bar.o all.o
    all: $(objects)

    # These files compile via implicit rules
    # Syntax - targets ...: target-pattern: prereq-patterns ...
    # In the case of the first target, foo.o, the target-pattern matches foo.o and sets the "stem" to be "foo".
    # It then replaces the '%' in prereq-patterns with that stem
    $(objects): %.o: %.c

    all.c:
        echo "int main() { return 0; }" > all.c

    %.c:
        touch $@

    clean:
        rm -f *.c *.o all

Static Pattern Rules and Filter
-------------------------------

While I introduce functions later on, I'll forshadow what you can do
with them. The `filter` function can be used in Static pattern rules to
match the correct files. In this example, I made up the `.raw` and
`.result` extensions.

    obj_files = foo.result bar.o lose.o
    src_files = foo.raw bar.c lose.c

    all: $(obj_files)

    $(filter %.o,$(obj_files)): %.o: %.c
        echo "target: $@ prereq: $<"
    $(filter %.result,$(obj_files)): %.result: %.raw
        echo "target: $@ prereq: $<" 

    %.c %.raw:
        touch $@

    clean:
        rm -f $(src_files)

Implicit Rules
--------------

Perhaps the most confusing part of make is the magic rules and variables
that are made. Here's a list of implicit rules:

-   Compiling a C program: `n.o` is made automatically from `n.c` with a
    command of the form `$(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS)`
-   Compiling a C++ program: `n.o` is made automatically from `n.cc` or
    `n.cpp` with a command of the form
    `$(CXX) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS)`
-   Linking a single object file: `n` is made automatically from `n.o`
    by running the command `$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) n.o $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS)`

As such, the important variables used by implicit rules are:

-   `CC`: Program for compiling C programs; default cc
-   `CXX`: Program for compiling C++ programs; default G++
-   `CFLAGS`: Extra flags to give to the C compiler
-   `CXXFLAGS`: Extra flags to give to the C++ compiler
-   `CPPFLAGS`: Extra flags to give to the C preprosessor
-   `LDFLAGS`: Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed
    to invoke the linker

<!-- -->

    CC = gcc # Flag for implicit rules
    CFLAGS = -g # Flag for implicit rules. Turn on debug info

    # Implicit rule #1: blah is built via the C linker implicit rule
    # Implicit rule #2: blah.o is built via the C compilation implicit rule, because blah.c exists
    blah: blah.o

    blah.c:
        echo "int main() { return 0; }" > blah.c

    clean:
        rm -f blah*

Pattern Rules
-------------

Pattern rules are often used but quite confusing. You can look at them
as two ways:

-   A way to define your own implicit rules
-   A simpler form of static pattern rules

Let's start with an example first:

    # Define a pattern rule that compiles every .c file into a .o file
    %.o : %.c
            $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@

Pattern rules contain a '%' in the target. This '%' matches any nonempty
string, and the other characters match themselves. â€˜%â€™ in a prerequisite
of a pattern rule stands for the same stem that was matched by the â€˜%â€™
in the target.

Here's another example:

    # Define a pattern rule that has no pattern in the prerequisites.
    # This just creates empty .c files when needed.
    %.c:
       touch $@

Double-Colon Rules
------------------

Double-Colon Rules are rarely used, but allow multiple rules to be
defined for the same target. If these were single colons, a warning
would be printed and only the second set of commands would run.

    all: blah

    blah::
        echo "hello"

    blah::
        echo "hello again"

Commands and execution
======================

Command Echoing/Silencing 
-------------------------

Add an `@` before a command to stop it from being printed\
You can also run make with `-s` to add an `@` before each line

    all: 
        @echo "This make line will not be printed"
        echo "But this will"

Command Execution
-----------------

Each command is run in a new shell (or at least the effect is as such)

    all: 
        cd ..
        # The cd above does not affect this line, because each command is effectively run in a new shell
        echo `pwd`

        # This cd command affects the next because they are on the same line
        cd ..;echo `pwd`

        # Same as above
        cd ..; \
        echo `pwd`

Default Shell
-------------

The default shell is `/bin/sh`. You can change this by changing the
variable SHELL:

    SHELL=/bin/bash

    cool:
        echo "Hello from bash"

Error handling with `-k`, `-i`, and `-` 
---------------------------------------

Add `-k` when running make to continue running even in the face of
errors. Helpful if you want to see all the errors of Make at once.\
Add a `-` before a command to suppress the error\
Add `-i` to make to have this happen for every command.

    one:
        # This error will be printed but ignored, and make will continue to run
        -false
        touch one

Interrupting or killing make
----------------------------

Note only: If you `ctrl+c` make, it will delete the newer targets it
just made.

Recursive use of make
---------------------

To recursively call a makefile, use the special `$(MAKE)` instead of
`make` because it will pass the make flags for you and won't itself be
affected by them.

    new_contents = "hello:\n\ttouch inside_file"
    all:
        mkdir -p subdir
        printf $(new_contents) | sed -e 's/^ //' > subdir/makefile
        cd subdir && $(MAKE)

    clean:
        rm -rf subdir

Use export for recursive make
-----------------------------

The export directive takes a variable and makes it accessible to
sub-make commands. In this example, `cooly` is exported such that the
makefile in subdir can use it.

Note: export has the same syntax as sh, but they aren't related
(although similar in function)

    new_contents = "hello:\n\\techo \$$(cooly)"

    all:
        mkdir -p subdir
        echo $(new_contents) | sed -e 's/^ //' > subdir/makefile
        @echo "---MAKEFILE CONTENTS---"
        @cd subdir && cat makefile
        @echo "---END MAKEFILE CONTENTS---"
        cd subdir && $(MAKE)

    # Note that variables and exports. They are set/affected globally.
    cooly = "The subdirectory can see me!"
    export cooly
    # This would nullify the line above: unexport cooly

    clean:
        rm -rf subdir

You need to export variables to have them run in the shell as well.

    one=this will only work locally
    export two=we can run subcommands with this

    all: 
        @echo $(one)
        @echo $$one
        @echo $(two)
        @echo $$two

`.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES` exports all variables for you.

    .EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES:
    new_contents = "hello:\n\techo \$$(cooly)"

    cooly = "The subdirectory can see me!"
    # This would nullify the line above: unexport cooly

    all:
        mkdir -p subdir
        echo $(new_contents) | sed -e 's/^ //' > subdir/makefile
        @echo "---MAKEFILE CONTENTS---"
        @cd subdir && cat makefile
        @echo "---END MAKEFILE CONTENTS---"
        cd subdir && $(MAKE)

    clean:
        rm -rf subdir

Arguments to make
-----------------

There's a nice [list of
options](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary)
that can be run from make. Check out `--dry-run`, `--touch`,
`--old-file`.

You can have multiple targets to make, i.e. `make clean run test` runs
the `clean` goal, then `run`, and then `test`.

Variables Pt. 2 
===============

Flavors and modification
------------------------

There are two flavors of variables:

-   recursive (use `=`) - only looks for the variables when the command
    is *used*, not when it's *defined*.
-   simply expanded (use `:=`) - like normal imperative programming --
    only those defined so far get expanded

<!-- -->

    # Recursive variable. This will print "later" below
    one = one ${later_variable}
    # Simply expanded variable. This will not print "later" below
    two := two ${later_variable}

    later_variable = later

    all: 
        echo $(one)
        echo $(two)

Simply expanded (using `:=`) allows you to append to a variable.
Recursive definitions will give an infinite loop error.

    one = hello
    # one gets defined as a simply expanded variable (:=) and thus can handle appending
    one := ${one} there

    all: 
        echo $(one)

`?=` only sets variables if they have not yet been set

    one = hello
    one ?= will not be set
    two ?= will be set

    all: 
        echo $(one)
        echo $(two)

Spaces at the end of a line are not stripped, but those at the start
are. To make a variable with a single space, use `$(nullstring)`

    with_spaces = hello   # with_spaces has many spaces after "hello"
    after = $(with_spaces)there

    nullstring =
    space = $(nullstring) # Make a variable with a single space.

    all: 
        echo "$(after)"
        echo start"$(space)"end

An undefined variable is actually an empty string!

    all: 
        # Undefined variables are just empty strings!
        echo $(nowhere)

Use `+=` to append

    foo := start
    foo += more

    all: 
        echo $(foo)

[String Substitution](#string-substitution) is also a really common and
useful way to modify variables. Also check out [Text
Functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html#Text-Functions)
and [Filename
Functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/File-Name-Functions.html#File-Name-Functions).

Command line arguments and override
-----------------------------------

You can override variables that come from the command line by using
`override`. Here we ran make with `make option_one=hi`

    # Overrides command line arguments
    override option_one = did_override
    # Does not override command line arguments
    option_two = not_override
    all: 
        echo $(option_one)
        echo $(option_two)

List of commands and define
---------------------------

"define" is actually just a list of commands. It has nothing to do with
being a function. Note here that it's a bit different than having a
semi-colon between commands, because each is run in a separate shell, as
expected.

    one = export blah="I was set!"; echo $$blah

    define two
    export blah=set
    echo $$blah
    endef

    # One and two are different.

    all: 
        @echo "This prints 'I was set'"
        @$(one)
        @echo "This does not print 'I was set' because each command runs in a separate shell"
        @$(two)

Target-specific variables
-------------------------

Variables can be assigned for specific targets

    all: one = cool

    all: 
        echo one is defined: $(one)

    other:
        echo one is nothing: $(one)

Pattern-specific variables
--------------------------

You can assign variables for specific target *patterns*

    %.c: one = cool

    blah.c: 
        echo one is defined: $(one)

    other:
        echo one is nothing: $(one)

Conditional part of Makefiles
=============================

Conditional if/else 
-------------------

    foo = ok

    all:
    ifeq ($(foo), ok)
        echo "foo equals ok"
    else
        echo "nope"
    endif

Check if a variable is empty
----------------------------

    nullstring =
    foo = $(nullstring) # end of line; there is a space here

    all:
    ifeq ($(strip $(foo)),)
        echo "foo is empty after being stripped"
    endif
    ifeq ($(nullstring),)
        echo "nullstring doesn't even have spaces"
    endif

Check if a variable is defined
------------------------------

ifdef does not expand variable references; it just sees if something is
defined at all

    bar =
    foo = $(bar)

    all:
    ifdef foo
        echo "foo is defined"
    endif
    ifdef bar
        echo "but bar is not"
    endif

\$(makeflags) 
-------------

This example shows you how to test make flags with `findstring` and
`MAKEFLAGS`. Run this example with `make -i` to see it print out the
echo statement.

    bar =
    foo = $(bar)

    all:
    # Search for the "-i" flag. MAKEFLAGS is just a list of single characters, one per flag. So look for "i" in this case.
    ifneq (,$(findstring i, $(MAKEFLAGS)))
        echo "i was passed to MAKEFLAGS"
    endif

Functions
=========

First Functions
---------------

*Functions* are mainly just for text processing. Call functions with
`$(fn, arguments)` or `${fn, arguments}`. You can make your own using
the
[call](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Call-Function.html#Call-Function)
builtin function. Make has a decent amount of [builtin
functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Functions.html).

    bar := ${subst not, totally, "I am not superman"}
    all: 
        @echo $(bar)

If you want to replace spaces or commas, use variables

    comma := ,
    empty:=
    space := $(empty) $(empty)
    foo := a b c
    bar := $(subst $(space),$(comma),$(foo))

    all: 
        @echo $(bar)

Do NOT include spaces in the arguments after the first. That will be
seen as part of the string.

    comma := ,
    empty:=
    space := $(empty) $(empty)
    foo := a b c
    bar := $(subst $(space), $(comma) , $(foo))

    all: 
        # Output is ", a , b , c". Notice the spaces introduced
        @echo $(bar)

String Substitution
-------------------

`$(patsubst pattern,replacement,text)` does the following:

"Finds whitespace-separated words in text that match pattern and
replaces them with replacement. Here pattern may contain a â€˜%â€™ which
acts as a wildcard, matching any number of any characters within a word.
If replacement also contains a â€˜%â€™, the â€˜%â€™ is replaced by the text that
matched the â€˜%â€™ in pattern. Only the first â€˜%â€™ in the pattern and
replacement is treated this way; any subsequent â€˜%â€™ is unchanged." ([GNU
docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html#Text-Functions))

The substitution reference `$(text:pattern=replacement)` is a shorthand
for this.

There's another shorthand that that replaces only suffixes:
`$(text:suffix=replacement)`. No `%` wildcard is used here.

Note: don't add extra spaces for this shorthand. It will be seen as a
search or replacement term.

    foo := a.o b.o l.a c.o
    one := $(patsubst %.o,%.c,$(foo))
    # This is a shorthand for the above
    two := $(foo:%.o=%.c)
    # This is the suffix-only shorthand, and is also equivalent to the above.
    three := $(foo:.o=.c)

    all:
        echo $(one)
        echo $(two)
        echo $(three)

The foreach function
--------------------

The foreach function looks like this: `$(foreach var,list,text)`. It
converts one list of words (separated by spaces) to another. `var` is
set to each word in list, and `text` is expanded for each word.\
This appends an exclamation after each word:

    foo := who are you
    # For each "word" in foo, output that same word with an exclamation after
    bar := $(foreach wrd,$(foo),$(wrd)!)

    all:
        # Output is "who! are! you!"
        @echo $(bar)

The if function
---------------

`if` checks if the first argument is nonempty. If so runs the second
argument, otherwise runs the third.

    foo := $(if this-is-not-empty,then!,else!)
    empty :=
    bar := $(if $(empty),then!,else!)

    all:
        @echo $(foo)
        @echo $(bar)

The call function
-----------------

Make supports creating basic functions. You "define" the function just
by creating a variable, but use the parameters `$(0)`, `$(1)`, etc. You
then call the function with the special `call` function. The syntax is
`$(call variable,param,param)`. `$(0)` is the variable, while `$(1)`,
`$(2)`, etc. are the params.

    sweet_new_fn = Variable Name: $(0) First: $(1) Second: $(2) Empty Variable: $(3)

    all:
        # Outputs "Variable Name: sweet_new_fn First: go Second: tigers Empty Variable:"
        @echo $(call sweet_new_fn, go, tigers)

The shell function
------------------

shell - This calls the shell, but it replaces newlines with spaces!

    all: 
        @echo $(shell ls -la) # Very ugly because the newlines are gone!

Other Features
==============

Include Makefiles
-----------------

The include directive tells make to read one or more other makefiles.
It's a line in the makefile makefile that looks like this:

    include filenames...

This is particularly useful when you use compiler flags like `-M` that
create Makefiles based on the source. For example, if some c files
includes a header, that header will be added to a Makefile that's
written by gcc. I talk about this more in the [Makefile
Cookbook](#makefile-cookbook)

The vpath Directive
-------------------

Use vpath to specify where some set of prerequisites exist. The format
is `vpath <pattern> <directories, space/colon separated>`\
`<pattern>` can have a `%`, which matches any zero or more characters.\
You can also do this globallyish with the variable VPATH

    vpath %.h ../headers ../other-directory

    some_binary: ../headers blah.h
        touch some_binary

    ../headers:
        mkdir ../headers

    blah.h:
        touch ../headers/blah.h

    clean:
        rm -rf ../headers
        rm -f some_binary

Multiline
---------

The backslash ("\\") character gives us the ability to use multiple
lines when the commands are too long

    some_file: 
        echo This line is too long, so \
            it is broken up into multiple lines

.phony 
------

Adding `.PHONY` to a target will prevent make from confusing the phony
target with a file name. In this example, if the file `clean` is
created, make clean will still be run. `.PHONY` is great to use, but
I'll skip it in the rest of the examples for simplicity.

    some_file:
        touch some_file
        touch clean

    .PHONY: clean
    clean:
        rm -f some_file
        rm -f clean

.delete\_on\_error 
------------------

The make tool will stop running a rule (and will propogate back to
prerequisites) if a command returns a nonzero exit status.\
`DELETE_ON_ERROR` will delete the target of a rule if the rule fails in
this manner. This will happen for all targets, not just the one it is
before like PHONY. It's a good idea to always use this, even though make
does not for historical reasons.

    .DELETE_ON_ERROR:
    all: one two

    one:
        touch one
        false

    two:
        touch two
        false

Makefile Cookbook
=================

Let's go through a really juicy Make example that works well for medium
sized projects.

The neat thing about this makefile is it automatically determines
dependencies for you. All you have to do is put your C/C++ files in the
`src/` folder.

    # Thanks to Job Vranish (https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/08/26/makefile-c-projects/)
    TARGET_EXEC := final_program

    BUILD_DIR := ./build
    SRC_DIRS := ./src

    # Find all the C and C++ files we want to compile
    SRCS := $(shell find $(SRC_DIRS) -name *.cpp -or -name *.c)

    # String substitution for every C/C++ file.
    # As an example, hello.cpp turns into ./build/hello.cpp.o
    OBJS := $(SRCS:%=$(BUILD_DIR)/%.o)

    # String substitution (suffix version without %).
    # As an example, ./build/hello.cpp.o turns into ./build/hello.cpp.d
    DEPS := $(OBJS:.o=.d)

    # Every folder in ./src will need to be passed to GCC so that it can find header files
    INC_DIRS := $(shell find $(SRC_DIRS) -type d)
    # Add a prefix to INC_DIRS. So moduleA would become -ImoduleA. GCC understands this -I flag
    INC_FLAGS := $(addprefix -I,$(INC_DIRS))

    # The -MMD and -MP flags together generate Makefiles for us!
    # These files will have .d instead of .o as the output.
    CPPFLAGS := $(INC_FLAGS) -MMD -MP

    # The final build step.
    $(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET_EXEC): $(OBJS)
        $(CC) $(OBJS) -o $@ $(LDFLAGS)

    # Build step for C source
    $(BUILD_DIR)/%.c.o: %.c
        mkdir -p $(dir $@)
        $(CC) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@

    # Build step for C++ source
    $(BUILD_DIR)/%.cpp.o: %.cpp
        mkdir -p $(dir $@)
        $(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) -c $< -o $@


    .PHONY: clean
    clean:
        rm -r $(BUILD_DIR)

    # Include the .d makefiles. The - at the front suppresses the errors of missing
    # Makefiles. Initially, all the .d files will be missing, and we don't want those
    # errors to show up.
    -include $(DEPS)
