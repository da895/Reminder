Looping through items in a collection is a frequent task for scripts. It
could be looping through files in a directory, or reading a text file
one line at a time.

Old School with GOTO
--------------------

The old-school way of looping on early versions of DOS was to use labels
and GOTO statements. This isn’t used much anymore, though it’s useful
for looping through command line arguments.

    :args
    SET arg=%~1
    ECHO %arg%
    SHIFT
    GOTO :args

New School with FOR
-------------------

The modern way to loop through files or text uses the `FOR` command. In
my opinion, `FOR` is the single most powerful command in DOS, and one of
the least used.

**GOTCHA:** The `FOR` command uses a special variable syntax of `%`
followed by a single letter, like `%I`. This syntax is slightly
different when `FOR` is used in a batch file, as it needs an extra
percent symbol, or `%%I`. This is a very common source of errors when
writing scripts. Should your for loop exit with invalid syntax, be sure
to check that you have the `%%` style variables.

Looping Through Files
---------------------

    FOR %I IN (%USERPROFILE%\*) DO @ECHO %I

Looping Through Directories
---------------------------

    FOR /D %I IN (%USERPROFILE%\*) DO @ECHO %I

Recursively loop through files in all subfolders of the %TEMP% folder

    FOR /R "%TEMP%" %I IN (*) DO @ECHO %I

Recursively loop through all subfolders in the %TEMP% folder

    FOR /R "%TEMP%" /D %I IN (*) DO @ECHO %I

Variable Substitution for Filenames
-----------------------------------
