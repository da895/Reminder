Functions are de facto way to reuse code in just about any procedural
coding language. While DOS lacks a bona fide function keyword, you can
fake it till you make it thanks to labels and the `CALL` keyword.

There are a few gotchas to pay attention to:

1.  Your quasi functions need to be defined as labels at the bottom of
    your script.
2.  The main logic of your script must have a `EXIT /B [errorcode]`
    statement. This keeps your main logic from falling through into your
    functions.

Defining a function
===================

In this example, we’ll implement a poor man’s version of the \*nix tee
utility to write a message to both a file and the stdout stream. We’ll
use a variable global to the entire script, `%log%` in the function.

    @ECHO OFF
    SETLOCAL

    :: script global variables
    SET me=%~n0
    SET log=%TEMP%\%me%.txt

    :: The "main" logic of the script
    IF EXIST "%log%" DELETE /Q %log% >NUL

    :: do something cool, then log it
    CALL :tee "%me%: Hello, world!"

    :: force execution to quit at the end of the "main" logic
    EXIT /B %ERRORLEVEL%

    :: a function to write to a log file and write to stdout
    :tee
    ECHO %* >> "%log%"
    ECHO %*
    EXIT /B 0

Calling a function
==================

We use the `CALL` keyword to invoke the quasi function labelled `:tee`.
We can pass command line arguments just like we’re calling another batch
file.

We have to remember to `EXIT /B` keyword at the end our function. Sadly,
there is no way to return anything other than an exit code.

Return values
=============

The return value of `CALL` will always be the exit code of the function.
Like any other invokation of an executable, the caller reads
`%ERRORLEVEL%` to get the exit code.

You have to get creative to pass anything other than integer return
codes. The function can `ECHO` to stdout, letting the caller decide to
handle the output by pipeling the output as the input to another
executable, redirecting to a file, or parsing via the `FOR` command.

The caller could also pass data by modifying a global variable, however,
I try to avoid this approach.
