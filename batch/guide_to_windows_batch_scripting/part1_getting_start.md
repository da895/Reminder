Getting Started with Windows Batch Scripting
--------------------------------------------

Windows batch scripting is incredibly accessible – it works on just
about any modern Windows machine. You can create and modify batch
scripts on just about any modern Windows machine. The tools come out of
the box: the Windows command prompt and a text editor like Notepad.exe.
It’s definitely far from the best shell scripting langauge, but, it gets
the job done. It’s my “duct tape” for Windows.

Launching the Command Prompt
----------------------------

Windows gurus launch the command prompt using the keyboard shortcut
`Windows Logo Key`+`R` (i.e., “Run”) &gt; Type `cmd.exe` then `Enter`.
This is way faster than navigating the Windows Start Menu to find the
Command Prompt.

Editing Batch Files
-------------------

The universal text editor for batch files is Notepad (`Windows Logo Key`
+ `R` &gt; Type `notepad` then `Enter`). Since batch files are just
ASCII text, you can probably use just about any text editor or word
processor. Very few editors do anything special for Batch files like
syntax highlighting or keyword support, so notepad is good enough fine
and will likely be installed on just about every Windows system you
encounter.

Viewing Batch Files
-------------------

I would stick with Notepad for viewing the contents of a batch file. In
Windows Explorer (aka, “My Computer”), you should be able to view a
batch file in Notepad by right clicking the file and seleting `Edit`
from the context menu. If you need to view the contents within a command
prompt window itself, you can use a DOS command like `TYPE myscript.cmd`
or `MORE myscript.cmd` or `EDIT myscript.cmd`

Batch File Names and File Extensions
------------------------------------

Assuming you are using Windows XP or newer, I recommend saving your
batch files with the file extension `.cmd`. Some seriously outdated
Windows versions used `.bat`, though I recommend sticking with the more
modern `.cmd` to [avoid some rare side effects with .bat
files](http://waynes-world-it.blogspot.fr/2008/08/difference-between-bat-and-cmd.html).

With the `.cmd` file extension, you can use just about filename you
like. I recommend avoiding spaces in filenames, as spaces only create
headaches in shell scripting. Pascal casing your filenames is an easy
way to avoid spaces (e.g., `HelloWorld.cmd` instead of
`Hello World.cmd`). You can also use punctuation characters like `.` or
`-` or `_` (e.g. `Hello.World.cmd`, `Hello-World.cmd`,
`Hello_World.cmd`).

Another thing with names to consider is avoiding names that use the same
name of any built-in commands, system binaries, or popular programs. For
example, I would avoid naming a script `ping.cmd` since there is a
widely used system binary named `ping.exe`. Things might get very
confusing if you try to run `ping` and inadvertently call `ping.cmd`
when you really wanted `ping.cmd`. (Stay tuned for how this could
happen.) I might called the script `RemoteHeartbeat.cmd` or something
similar to add some context to the script’s name and also avoid any
naming collisions with any other executable files. Of course, there
could be a very unique circumstance in which you want to modify the
default behavior of `ping` in which this naming suggestion would not
apply.

Saving Batch Files in Windows
-----------------------------

Notepad by default tries to save all files as plain jane text files. To
get Notepad to save a file with a `.cmd` extension, you will need to
change the “Save as type” to “All Files (*.*)”. See the screenshot below
for an example of saving a script named “HelloWorld.cmd” in Notepad.

Running your Batch File
-----------------------

The easy way to run your batch file in Windows is to just double click
the batch file in Windows Explorer (aka “My Computer”). Unfortunately,
the command prompt will not give you much of a chance to see the output
and any errors. The command prompt window for the script will disappear
as soon as the script exits. (We will learn how to handle this problem
in [Part 10 – Advanced Tricks](/blog/2012/03/DD/title/) ).

When editing a new script, you will likely need to run the batch file in
an existing command window. For newbies, I think the easiest foolproof
way to run your script is to drag and drop the script into a command
prompt window. The command prompt will enter the full path to your
script on the command line, and will quote any paths containing spaces.

Some other tips to running batch files:

-   You can recall previous commands using the up arrow and down arrow
    keys to navigate the command line history.
-   I usually run the script as
    `%COMPSPEC% /C /D "C:\Users\User\SomeScriptPath.cmd" Arg1 Arg2 Arg3`
    This runs your script in a new command prompt child process. The
    `/C` option instructs the child process to quit when your script
    quits. The `/D` disables any auto-run scripts (this is optional,
    but, I use auto-run scripts). The reason I do this is to keep the
    command prompt window from automatically closing should my script,
    or a called script, call the `EXIT` command. The `EXIT` command
    automatically closes the command prompt window unless the `EXIT` is
    called from a child command prompt process. This is annoying because
    you lose any messages printed by your script.

Comments
--------

The official way to add a comment to a batch file is with the `REM`
(Remark) keyword:

     REM This is a comment!

The power user method is to use `::`, which is a hack to uses the the
label operator `:` twice, which is almost always ignored.

Most power authors find the `::` to be less distracting than `REM`. Be
warned though there are a few places where `::` will cause errors.

      :: This is a comment too!! (usually!)

For example, a `FOR` loop will error out with `::` style comments.
Simply fall back to using `REM` if you think you have a situation like
this.

Silencing Display of Commands in Batch Files
--------------------------------------------

The first non-comment line of a batch file is usually a command to turn
off printing (ECHO’ing) of each batch file line.

     @ECHO OFF

The `@` is a special operator to suppress printing of the command line.
Once we set ECHO’ing to off, we won’t need the `@` operator again in our
script commands.

You restore printing of commands in your script with:

    ECHO ON

Upon exit of your script, the command prompt will automatically restore
ECHO to it’s previous state.

Debugging Your Scripts
----------------------

Batch files invole a lot of trial and error coding. Sadly, I don’t know
of any true debugger for Windows batch scripts. Worse yet, I don’t know
of a way to put the command processor into a verbose state to help
troubleshoot the script (this is the common technique for Unix/Linux
scripts.) Printing custom ad-hoc debugging messages is about your only
option using the `ECHO` command. Advanced script writers can do some
trickery to selectively print debugging messages, though, I prefer to
remove the debugging/instrumentation code once my script is functioning
as desired.
