Guide to Windows Batch Scripting 
================================

Why Windows?
------------

This series will share some of the tips and tricks I’ve picked up
through the years of working with Windows professionally. I’ll be the
first to admit the Unix shells of the world are far superior to the
Windows command prompt (or even Windows PowerShell). Windows is a fact
of life for most professionals writing code for coporate customers; this
series aims to make life with Windows a little easier.

Why DOS-style Batch Files?
--------------------------

This series will share some conventions I picked up along the way for
scripting in Windows via command prompt batch files. The Windows
PowerShell is definitely sweet, but, I still like batch files for their
portability and low friction. The Windows command line is very stable –
no worrying about the PowerShell interpreter path, which version of
PowerShell the server is running, etc.
