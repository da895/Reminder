> MRAM (Magnetic RAM) is a memory technology that uses electron spin to store information (an MRAM device is a Spintronics device). MRAM has the potential to become a universal memory - able to combine the densities of storage memory with the speed of SRAM, all the while being non-volatile and power efficient.

> MRAM technology is still far from realizing its potential, but as of early 2020, there are MRAM chips on the market ranging from very small ones to 1Gb chips, and companies are adopting this technology for many applications.

> MRAM can resist high radiation, can operate in extreme temperature conditions, and can be tamper resistant. This makes MRAM suitable for automotive, industrial, military and space applications, and these are important segments for MRAM developers.

> Many companies are also developing and starting to produce MRAM chips, including IBM and Samsung, Toshiba, Everspin, Avalanche Technologies, Spin Transfer Technologies and Crocus.
